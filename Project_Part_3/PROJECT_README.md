Part 1 reads an input file containing the current state of a checkers game and determines if it is valid or not. If it is valid it sends a summary of the setup to standard output. If it is invalid it sends an error to standard error explaining the error and near which line it occured.

Part 3 finds all the possible moves up until the depth specified by the user is reached.
